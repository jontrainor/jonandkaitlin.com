		<div class="overviewSummary">
			<p>
				Jon grew up in New London, New Hampshire, moved to Illinois to attend college, and settled in Chicago after graduating.
				He is a web developer.
				He is a die hard Patriots fan, much to Kaitlin's dismay.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kaitlin grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana, moved to St Louis to attend college, and after finishing graduate school moved to Chicago.
				She is a pediatric speech-language pathologist.
				She is a die hard Peyton Manning and Colts fan, much to Jon's dismay. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We met through mutual friends on St. Patrick's Day in 2010.
				Five months later, we went on our first date. Two years later, we moved into our first apartment together in Wicker Park, Chicago. 
				A year and a half later, we got engaged over Valentine's Day weekend in South Haven, Michigan.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are looking forward to staying in Chicago, for the time being, and seeing what the future holds for this house divided.
